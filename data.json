      "introduction": "A tesseract has landed on Earth and you've been brought on board the smartest of the smart to decode why it came here and what it's trying to tell us. <br> <br> Signals from the Stars, made in Unity, was my capstone project. I used the project to push my programming and game design abilities further than ever before. The games I typically make are minimalist, 2D, short, and replayable. This was an ambitious project for me and was quite the learning experience. It started with the idea of sending and receiving codes to solve a puzzle box, with mechanics heavily relying on reading string inputs for patterns. Many iterations later, it's become a game of logic puzzles meets puzzle box meets alien story. I am very proud of this game.",

All you're doing from 9 to 5 is standing at a conveyer line waiting for packages to come down to sort them. How crazy can it get? <br> <br> Sorting Incorporated, made in Unity, started as a way to get more familiar with Unity, specifically with a simple test with the sprite mask. It wound up becoming my first game that I would fully develop front to back. Projects for classes usually lack key things like tutorials and settings and I wanted to bring this game up to the standard for real games. This project took around 2 months.",

In this endless runner, you do gnarly tricks on ramps to gain boost and pass through slolams to gain upgrade points. How far will you shred? <br> <br> Slope Shredder, made in Unreal Engine, was a student-run project made over the course of a semester. The class's original intent was to work with a company on their game, but we felt dissatisfied with how things were going, so we quickly cut ties and decided to make our own game as a class. Our project was such a success that the class was reworked to function this way for future classes. The project was originally built for mobile and made its way onto the Google Play store for Android. Later, I tweaked it to run on PC as well. My class was a small focused talented group and I'm so fortunate I was able to be part of it.",

      "introduction": "In this Solitaire variation, you get to look through the whole deck for patterns of cards. Different patterns allow you to remove different cards, and your goal is to get your hand down to 2 or less cards. Think ahead and remove cards to set up combo chains. <br> <br> Chain Solitaire, made in Unity, is an original Solitaire variation I came up with. The idea started from me playing One Hand Solitaire in real life and making tweak after tweak to the rules until it felt like a Solitaire game that wasn't just dependant on what your shuffle was. This was a 2 month solo project. Before Chain Solitiare, I would design games based on what I was capable of. Because this was a real game I was recreating, I had to follow the design rigidly which was a fun challenge. What I'm most proud of with this game is that people can take the rules and play it with a real deck of cards.",

As you explore, you piece together more of your past and explore the cursed pyramid you've found yourself in. <br> <br> Desolate, made in Unity, is a discontinued demo for a horror RPG. Desolate was my first big project I tackled in Unity. I was the solo programmer for the group. When development first started, I was attempting to build off of Unity's premade RPG tutorial project. The start of the project was rocky because of this. I was trying to understand a professional level project as pretty much a newbie. However, as the project progressed, I started building mechanics from scratch and I began to pick up pace in the way I expected from the start. In the end I learned some lessons and I was able to bring the project together in a really cool way.",
