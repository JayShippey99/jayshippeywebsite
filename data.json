How far will you shred?<br> <br> Slope Shredder, made in Unreal Engine, was a student-run project made over the course of a semester. The class's original intent was to work with a company on their game, but we felt dissatisfied with how things were going, so we quickly cut ties and decided to make our own game as a class. Our project was such a success that the class was reworked to function this way for future classes. The project was originally built for mobile and made its way onto the Google Play store for Android. Later, I tweaked it to run on PC as well. My class was a small focused talented group and I'm so fortunate I was able to be part of it.",

Different patterns allow you to remove different cards, and your goal is to get your hand down to 2 or less cards. Think ahead and remove cards to set up combo chains. <br> <br> Chain Solitaire, made in Unity, is an original Solitaire variation I came up with. The idea started from me playing One Hand Solitaire in real life and making tweak after tweak to the rules until it felt like a Solitaire game that wasn't just dependant on what your shuffle was. This was a 2 month solo project. Before Chain Solitiare, I would design games based on what I was capable of. For this game I had a blueprint for the gameplay that I needed to obey, and it was a success. What I'm most proud of with this game is that people can take the rules and play it with a real deck of cards.",
