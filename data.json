The class's original intent was to work with a company on their game, but we felt dissatisfied with how things were going, so we quickly cut ties and decided to make our own game as a class. Our project was such a success that the class was reworked to function this way for future classes. The project was originally built for mobile and made its way onto the Google Play store for Android. Later, I tweaked it to run on PC as well. My class was a small focused talented group and I'm so fortunate I was able to be part of it.",

The idea started from me playing One Hand Solitaire in real life and making tweak after tweak to the rules until it felt like a Solitaire game that wasn't just dependant on what your shuffle was. This was a 2 month solo project. Before Chain Solitiare, I would design games based on what I was capable of. Because this was a real game I was recreating, I had to follow the design rigidly which was a fun challenge. What I'm most proud of with this game is that people can take the rules and play it with a real deck of cards.",

The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose."
