Now, the dirt and cracks are applied using a cheaper version of the 'WorldAlignedTexture' node I created. I effectively just rebuilt the node, only keeping what I needed.<br></br><u>Painted Wall Texture:</u><br></br>The painted wall mask that separates the colors starts with a black and white texture with a line of 'paint strokes' to transition between the colors. This texture is clamped.<br></br>I then scale that texture in world space to match the width and height of the rooms. Since the texture is clamped I used a frac node to make it tile vertically for when the building has multiple floors. I also added variables to offset the texture's position.<br></br>I masked the texture using normals so it would only apply to the walls, then using the paint texture and more normal masking I multiplied the walls with 4 colors based on their quadrant."

      "goal": "Give the players a lot of freedom with creating a custom look for their hamster. We figured it would be easiest on our work load to make a customizable pattern than model a bunch of accessories to choose between. We quickly realized that this freedom was maybe more expressive than if we used prebuilt accessories.",
      "info": "<u>Material Breakdown:</u><br></br>The material works by offsetting, scaling, and rotating the UVs to manipulate the texture. The color changing is done by lerping between your selections using the pattern mask. The order of the offset, scale, and rotation is important so they are most predictably controlled by the player. Beyond that, the bulk of how this works is pretty normal.<br></br>The two sliders that are a little different are the color weight and hardness sliders. The weight slider essentially pushes the colors toward one color or the other and the hardness slider transitions between a blurred and hard version of each pattern texture.<br></br><u>UI Implementation:</u><br></br>The UI was the hardest part of it all. There's not much breakdown to be had here, just a lot of code to make user experience as nice as possible. Things like getting the sliders and their respective text boxes working together, applying and saving the changes vs reverting them, and the hat options. The color wheels are a very nifty plugin called 'Easy Color Picker'.<br></br>Once the UI interaction felt good then it was just a matter of making the widget code change the material."

(Making one bigger also helped the readability of how many clips you have).<br></br>Damage indicators - An arc appears with a shake and keeps pointing in the direction of the hit as you move.<br></br><u>How The Materials React:</u><br></br>Images in widgets can have their material set to a material you made as long as it's a UI material. So all I'm doing is getting access to these materials and changing their parameters. I'm doing this either through direct blueprint communication or using widget animations (you can change material parameters through the animation timeline here, it's pretty cool).<br></br>Making UI elements with shaders is not only easier to work with and more customizable, but it's more performant than relying solely on widgets. And when it comes to making art with code, this is my JAM. I had a blast working on these."

Create a black-to-white gradient in object space that starts from the bottom bounds of the mesh to the top.<br></br>Create a blueprint that moves the mesh around, for me I made it move around with controls like a character.<br></br>Send variables like what direction it's moving, the distance it moved, and the amount it rotated since the last frame to the material. Because the past value will become the current value next frame, I added lerp nodes so the past values took longer to get to the current value. This helped exaggerate the effect.<br></br>The material uses the movement data and combines it with the bottom-to-top gradient. Instead of saying “put the vertices where they were x amount of time ago” it was easier to just find the direction of movement and the difference in position and use that to push the verts in the opposite direction, giving a trailing behind effect.<br></br>For example, if I were moving straight down at 1.5m/s, this gives me a direction and an intensity. I would offset all the verts by +1.5 vertically (since it's opposite of the direction I'm falling), but since that gets multiplied by the gradient, the top gets the most stretched and the bottom stays true to where it is. (The values here aren't 1 to 1 how it works in the code, but I wanted to keep it simple to help visualize).<br></br>Additional parameters were added to the material to control the strength and curve of the gradient."

Scratch pad code that makes each point move toward the previous one (this reels the tentacle back in).
